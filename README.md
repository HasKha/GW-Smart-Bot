# GW Smart Bot
*An AI project for a robotics class*

**Note: this project is a (working) proof of concept, but not a bot ready to use. If you are looking for something to download and run this is not for you**

This project introduces a path planning algorithm using TSP and clustering. We provide a visualization tool to analise the behavior of the bot, and we show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art.

For more information, check the presentation, report, or video.
